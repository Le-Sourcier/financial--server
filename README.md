# financial--tsome_server
tsome_server powers Tsomenenyo, a financial platform uniting individuals to pool funds. Members request loans based on conditions, and approved loans come with interest. Repayment occurs at the commitment period's end, usually year-end, except in force majeure. This ensures fair loan management, promoting transparency and trust.
